  <description>
  To use <o>spat5.multi.connect</o>, select objects to connect and hit the [ ! ] button to connect all outlets to all inlets. 
  <br/> Additional features include: [ \ ] to connect one outlet to multiple inlets, [ / ] to connect multiple outlets to one inlet, and [ | ] to match all selected objects to the top obect's x position and width values.
  <br/><br/>
  To make connections, <o>spat5.multi.connect</o> first needs to know how many inlets/outlets to try as an argument or as an int message.  note:  there will be ignorable error messages if your number of connections setting is larger than the number of inlets or outlets of the selected objects.
  <br/><br/>
  <o>spat5.multi.connect</o> has been developed by Rama Gottfried (2012); based on the maxtoolbox by Nathanaël Lécaudé.
